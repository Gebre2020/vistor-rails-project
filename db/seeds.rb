# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# user1 = User.create(username: "jhon", email: "jhon@jhon.com", password: "jhon")
# user2 = User.create(username: "sara", email: "sara@sara.com", password: "sara")

# location1 = Location.create(city: "Chicago", country: "IL, USA")
# location2 = Location.create(city: "Milwaukee", country: "WI, USA")

# travel1 = Travel.create(name: "Willis Tower", address: "233 S. Wacker Dr", user_id: 1, location_id: 1)
